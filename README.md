# ActivityLogger
*Log your activity to boost your productivity*

ActivityLogger is a simple time-clocking application that keeps track of when you start and stop tasks, so that you can get a better idea of how you're spending your time.

It works using four simple actions, **START**, **STOP**, **PAUSE**, and **UNPAUSE**. All you have to do is indicate that you've done one of those four things, and then this application will be able to provide you with some analytics about how you're spending your time.
